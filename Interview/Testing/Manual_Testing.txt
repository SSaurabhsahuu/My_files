Error, Bug, Failure
Error		When software is behaving in unexpected way in Developement phase
Bug		When software is behaving in unexpected way in Testing phase
Failure		When software is behaving in unexpected way after Deployement  when customer is using it

SDLC	Software Development Life Cycle
 Requirement analysis
 Design phase
 Development
 Testing
 Maintenance

Waterfall Model
Spiral Model
V-Model

Static Testing		Review, walkthrough, Inspection of documents
Dynamic Testing		Actual Testing	(White Box, Black Box)

Agile Model
	Agile follows Iterative (many SDLC)  &  Incremental (features get added in each cycle)  process
	Develop a software with some features so that customer do not has to wait
	Good Communication between Designers, Developers, Testers, Customer
Scrum
	It is a framework used to build software product by following Agile Principles
	A scrum team has
	1) Product Owner	defines & prioritize the features & communicate with customer
	2) Scrum Master		Facilitates & drives the Agile Process in SDLC and team Members
	3) Dev Team

Testing Techniques / Test Case Design Techniques	( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsw0pywdR5k&list=PLUDwpEzHYYLseflPNg0bUKfLmAbO2JnE9&index=6 
	It is used to	
			1)	Reduce no. of Test Cases
			2)	Increase Coverage
Types
1) Equilance Class Partition		Divide the data in multiple classes
2) Boundary Value Analysis		min, min-1,min+1	max, max-1, max+1
3) Decision Table Based Testing		when we have diff actions to perform based on many conditions & 
					combination of conditions eg.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsw0pywdR5k&list=PLUDwpEzHYYLseflPNg0bUKfLmAbO2JnE9&index=6
4) State Transition			eg.  3 chances to input right username and password
5) Error Guessing			Experienced testers can guess the bugs
