Git :  is a Distributed version control system that takes snapshot of whole project insted of storing only differenes
       that other VCS do.
       It basically is mini file system with powerfull tools like Branching, merge,commit etc.

An organization has its project in master repositry of github.( Remote Repositry )
So when a Developer wants to make changes in it he 1st downloads(clone ) it in his computer.(Local Repositry )
( both Remote and local repositry have there own master branch and  new branches )
To do it the Developer runs below commands in his terminal / Command prompt   

1) Make a folder(repository) in your pc where you want project
2) in cmd go to this location 
3) git init           (this initializes a hidden .git folder )
4) git clone https://github.com/SSaurabhsahuu/djangoEcom.git     or paste your local project in local repo before git init
5) git add Sorting_Algorithms_Visualizer            
6) git commit -m  "Commit project folder"              "Commit project folder" it tells why this commit was done
